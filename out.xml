China, then theRepublic of China, was an original member of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT) -- the predecessor of the WTO. But after thecommunists prevailed on the mainland, the nationalists were driven toTaiwan.</P><P>In 1950, the nationalist government, still acting as therecognized government of China, withdrew China from GATT. This moveleft both mainland China and Taiwan outside the world trading system.</P><P>In the early 1990s, Taiwan launched an intense campaign to rejointhe GATT. In doing so, it made two important initial concessions.</P><P>First, it offered to join the GATT without the special treatmentreserved for developing countries and assume all responsibilities ofmembership at the outset while granting significant market accessconcessions to the United States and other GATT members.</P><P>Second, recognizing mainland China's concerns, Taiwan identifieditself as a customs territory in its application, not an independentcountry.</P><P>Mainland China was not satisfied, however. Though itself not aWTO member, Beijing has lined up several WTO members to work againstTaiwan membership. The unstated compromise that the US and mainlandChina quietly struck was that Taiwan would be allowed to join oncemainland China becomes a WTO member.</P><P>Once again, however, mainland China's WTO membership campaign isshowing signs of flagging. Not because, as mainland China contends,the United States is blocking its membership, but because it is notwilling to make the concessions necessary to comply with the WTO,Mastel said.</P><P>After months of promises to table a major offer, mainland Chinahas once again disappointed its trading partners by putting forwardan incomplete offer, which calls for a long phaseout of blatantlyWTO-illegal quotas. It didn't even bother to address market accessfor services.</P><P>"There are still some outstanding trade issues with Taiwanregarding agriculture, intellectual property some high tariffs and afew other matters. No credible observer would deny, however, thatTaiwan's market is already much more open than mainland China's,"Mastel said in his article.</P><P>"Beyond that, the United States already exports nearly twice asmuch to Taiwan as to mainland China. Taiwan is an excellent candidatefor WTO Membership."</P><P>Mastel stressed that in light of mainland China's continuedfailure to negotiate seriously, it is time for Washington to launch aserious campaign for Taiwan's WTO membership, regardless of whathappens with mainland China's application.</P><P>In order to remain consistent with the "one China" policy, Taiwanshould continue seeking membership as a customs territory, not anindependent country. It is widely ignored now, but this formula wasused to bring Hong Kong (at the time, another Chinese province beyondBeijing's control) into the GATT a decade ago without Chineseobjection; it should work now with Taiwan, Mastel pointed out.</P><P>Moving forward with Taiwan's WTO membership puts the burden onmainland China to explain why a strong WTO candidate such as Taiwanshould remain outside the WTO simply because Beijing is unwilling tocomply with WTO entry requirements, he said.</P><P>"Perhaps this would force mainland China to finally open itsmarket or to accede to Taiwan's membership. Either outcome would be avictory."</P></TEXT></DOC>

But only three leaders turned up, he reported.</P><P>One was President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China onTaiwan, who arrived with 300 officials and businessmen and 200journalists in the diplomatic style he has perfected since hiscontroversial visit to the United States, Handelman pointed out.</P><P>He said Lee's presence, not to mention the fact that Taiwan haslargely bankrolled the conference, meant mainland China would stayaway.</P><P>Beijing has been fuming for the past several years over Taiwan'ssuccessful courtship of Central America, according to the Canadianjournalist. It nearly doomed a UN-sponsored truce in Guatemalabecause of that country's support for Taiwan at the United Nations,he noted.</P><P>Taipei's Panama gambit was apparently the last straw. MainlandChina, the third-largest user of the canal, made clear it would lookon attendance at the conference as an unfriendly act. Only Hondurasand Nicaragua, two Central American nations that maintain diplomaticrelations with Taiwan, sent their leaders, he said.</P><P>Most of the shipping companies that make the canal a US$362million-a-year enterprise did show up, along with VIPs from theUnited States and other countries, he added.</P><P>But the geopolitical quarrel between the two Asian giantsdeflated Panama's moment of glory, Handelman said. And it has added anew and gratuitous strain to what is shaping up already to be ahemispheric crisis-in-waiting, he predicted.</P><P>The underlying problem remains the doubt about whether Panamawill be able to control its destiny even when it takes charge of thecanal, he said.</P><P>"What we're seeing here already is the marketization of thecanal," he quoted one of the protesters outside this week'sconference who warned that Panama was again in danger of selling offits national birthright to foreigners.</P><P>The intrusion of Asian power politics into this combustible mixdoesn't help matters. But it's only another sign that the end of theCold War has not ended the shadowy intrigues inside this hemisphere,Handelman commented.</P></TEXT></DOC>

The Clintonadministration has rejected Beijing's latest proposals, and demandedgreater openness in services and agriculture and faster timetable forreducing trade barriers and subsidies, said Bruce Stokes, seniorfellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C..</P><P>In an article contributed to the Financial Times, Stokes said theimmediate outlook is for more argument. US and mainland Chinesenegotiators will meet again this month to stitch together a WTO dealto be unveiled at the late-October summit between mainland ChinesePresident Jiang Zemin and US President Bill Clinton. The betting inWashington is that the negotiations will again come up short and thatno deal will be possible before the next Sino-American summit,scheduled for early next year.</P><P>Whatever the hurdles, however, mainland China's admission to theWTO is inevitable. So while the lower-level negotiators hammer outthe details, senior US and European trade officials should devise acommon strategy for the complications that will occur once Beijingbecomes a WTO member, Stokes advised.</P><P>Too much is at stake to delay, he said. A mishandling of mainlandChina's role in the WTO could undermine many of the advantages Europeand the United States hope to gain from the present accession talks.Most important, the long-term credibility of the WTO could be hurt ifmainland China becomes a "problem" member, Stokes pointed out.</P><P>The stakes for mainland China are high: the WTO is asking it tochange the very structure of its economy. To meet the obligations ofmembership, Beijing must wind down subsidies and protection for itsindustries. But the mainland Chinese government is wary of triggeringunemployment by too rapid reform.</P><P>Facing the dilemma, whatever its intentions when it signs theaccession agreement, Beijing may find itself unable to meet all ofits WTO commitments in a timely fashion, he said.</P><P>In such circumstances, like any WTO member, the mainland Chinesegovernment can be hauled before a disputes resolution panel. Butgiven the problems with the mainland Chinese economy, the number ofthese cases could soon get out of hand. No government of a majorcountry -- be it mainland China, Japan or the United States -- islikely to continue to play a game it consistently loses, Stokescautioned.</P><P>What if Beijing refuses to comply with WTO decisions or threatensto withdraw, he asked. If Brussels and Washington back off, the WTOcould lose international credibility and future leverage overmainland China, he said.</P><P>To avoid such problems Brussels and Washington need to tellBeijing now which of its WTO commitments are of greatest importanceto them, where failure to comply would trigger immediate WTO cases,he said.</P><P>The European Commission and the Clinton administration also needto find new means for dealing with mainland Chinese trade problems,short of a wave of WTO cases that could alienate Beijing intobreaking away from the WTO, Stokes advised.</P><P>"In the end, it is not only the terms of China's accession to theWTO but the nature of its participation that matters to Europe andthe United States," he said.</P></TEXT></DOC>

In fact, it is amassive one which reflects the real world of modern development inwhich economic growth seems to widen rather than lessen the gapbetween rich and poor, Britain's Guardian newspaper said in a Sundayeditorial.</P><P>Large parts of Asia have been praised in glowing terms as modelsfor development: the famous "little tigers" have been joined bycommunist China and to some extent, India, as exemplars for the West.</P><P>Yet 35 percent of all Indians subsist on less than the equivalentof one US dollar a day, and 20 percent do so across East Asia -- incommunist China, the percentage is one-third.</P><P>The crude totals are staggering: over half a billion South Asiansand more than 450 million East Asians live below this poverty line.The figures are much worse when disaggregated: inland communistChina, northeastern Thailand and the eastern islands of Indonesia lagfar behind; India's rural and urban poor form the majority in somestates and cities.</P><P>As a separate report on India issued recently by the bankremarks, this burden of poverty imposes an "oppressive weight" uponthe country, the Guardian pointed out.</P><P>The World Bank has come a long way in recent years towardsacknowledging that economic growth is not the sole measurement ofhuman progress and that reducing poverty cannot be left to thetrickle-down of newly generated wealth to the poorer sectors ofsociety.</P><P>Even the statistics of poverty have been revised upwards -- incommunist China from 100 million to more than 300 million (India hasalmost doubled its estimate of those below the line).</P><P>In its report on poverty reduction earlier this year, the Bankrecognized that other measures will be required.</P><P>First, "prevailing conditions must enable the poor to participatein economic growth." and second, it is essential to ensure that "thebenefits of growth favor the poor disproportionately."</P><P>This is fine in theory, but just how can the new Asia elites bepersuaded to apply this principle of reverse discrimination to thecreation of wealth?</P><P>Presenting the two reports, the World Bank's managing directorhas placed the need for investment in "human capital," such as healthand education, on the same level with sound monetary policy andindustrial investment.</P><P>This is a healthy reversion to earlier developmental thinkingwhich attached more importance to non-growth factors.

Two years ago, Lin had hadenough. She set up the Ming-Hsouei Innovation Incubator, aTaipei-based enterprise that helps small businesses get started, theCitizen said.</P><P>One reason is her 22-year-old daughter, now a university student."I wanted to show her you didn't have to work for 10 years to make abusiness succeed, that with the right ideas and management it canhappen much faster," Lin was quoted as saying.</P><P>So far, 10 tiny companies are growing under her wing, nurtured byher ability to help find finances and provide management advice, thereport added.

"Thus China's current economicsuccess puts off the day when the leadership must face the apparentcontradiction between tyrannical government and a more open economy,"he said.</P><P>It is equally imprudent to base American strategy on theassumption that Beijing's international behavior can be tamed through"integration" into the international order, he went on.</P><P>He expressed the belief that Washington's strategy toward Beijingmust have elements of containment in it, saying a policy that offerscarrots only, and that does not even admit the possibility of sticks,can only tempt Beijing leaders to try and get away with as much asthey can.</P></TEXT></DOC>

Hohuan incentral Taiwan.</P><P>According to Prof. Lin Liang-kung from Tunghai University, whofound the animal, the female, adult stoat weighs 20 grams and isaround 20 centimeters long. It is what is known as a "relic species"and is considered as important a species in biological terms asTaiwan's other relic species, the Formosan landlocked salmon. "Relicspecies" refers to a species which has survived from a previous age,such as before the last ice age, when many other species died out.</P><P>By comparing the DNA of the rare stoat with that of its distantrelatives in Hokkaido island, in northern Japan, Lin found that themammal is descended from the Japanese northern stoat and overprobably 10,000 to 60,000 years, has evolved as a unique species inthe isolated highland area of Taiwan which is believed to be thecreature's only habitat.</P><P>It is biologically significant that an essentially Arctic specieslike the stoat, which is likely to be named the Formosan stoat, canbe found in subtropical Taiwan, Lin noted, adding that it suggeststhat more previously unknown or rare species of animals and plantsmay remain to be discovered in remote and mountainous areas ofTaiwan.</P><P>According to biological records, this is the third stoat of thiskind to have been found in Taiwan. A similar specimen was found deadin 1966 and is now stored at the National Taichung Museum of NaturalSciences. A second one was captured five years ago by Prof. Lin nearcentral Taiwan's Jade Mountain, but he released the animal, mistakingit for a more common weasel.</P><P>Since Lin found the stoat in June, he has kept it in a lab atTunghai University, feeding her threaded pork and making video tapesof her behavior.</P><P>Lin and his researchers are currently establishing observationposts in areas above 3,000 meters in the Jade Mountain National Park,in the hope that more specimens will be found and thus contribute toresearch into the species.</P><P>Lin's only worry is that the Formosan stoat's population is underthreat, as it is believed to share its habitat with weasels, whichare far more abundant and will compete with the stoats for limitedfood resources. Both species are ferocious carnivores which preymainly on mice, shrews and voles.</P></TEXT></DOC>

And theybelieve greater openness of these markets is the cure for theregion's economic woes.</P><P>But on the other hand, the delegates from a group of 24 members-- which comprises developing nations from Africa and Latin Americaas well as Asia -- contended that market openness must take intoaccount member countries' policy, institutional and financial systemconditions.</P><P>The wide gap lies in the different development status of the twoblocs of nations.</P><P>Developed countries generally have a stronger economic base and,in addition, are blessed with greater political stability.</P><P>The developed nations have proved to be less subject to majorcapital outflows even in the event their financial systems goseriously wrong.</P><P>By contrast, many developing countries are not so fortunate as tohave such a solid economic foundation and a stable political system.... They generally rely heavily on foreign capital in their effortsto develop economically. The problem with such reliance is thatforeign funds, especially those for investment in the stock andmonetary markets, often pull out of a country just as fast as theyflow in.</P><P>This is why many developing states are selective in solicitingforeign investment.</P><P>However, it is both unrealistic and unfeasible for pursuing sucha protectionist policy. Unrealistic because when an economy grows andexpands, it tends to require a greater infusion of capital. Yet torestrict the inflow of funds from abroad is to deny an importantsource of funding for an economy.</P><P>It is unfeasible for developing nations to continue to maintainbarriers to foreign investment in their domestic financial markets,because they can hardly do so without risking retaliation by advancedcountries.</P><P>But the advanced nations, in pressing foreign governments to opentheir markets, do need to take into account those governments'domestic economic conditions and give them the breathing spacenecessary to make adjustment.</P><P>Some delegates to the Hong Kong IMF meeting proposed to set up afund to counter new currency attacks.

"He mustcede power to the provinces and the cities, as well as to privatebusinessmen and industrialists, if he is to retain power by meetingthe people's needs."</P><P>"The more economic freedom he allows, the more pressing andstrident will be demands for greater political and cultural freedom,"Elegant said.</P><P>"Granting those demands would in the long run bring down thedictatorial Communist Party, which has just reavowed its need anddetermination to rule by repression," he said.</P><P>He said mainland China's economic liberalization not onlyinspires demands for political liberalization but automaticallydecreases the power of the Communist Party.</P><P>He said economic liberalization has caused havoc for theCommunist Party and its leaders in the past two decades.</P><P>"The initial relaxation of dogmatism two decades ago resulted infar greater production. It also produced unintended consequences.First was the Democracy Wall in Beijing in 1979, when giant postersdenounced communist authoritarianism and ineptitude -- until allposters were banned and their authors jailed," he noted.</P><P>"In 1989, the climactic result of Deng's economic relaxation wasthe pro-democracy movement that demanded an end to communistcorruption and inflation -- and a greater popular voice in theprocess of government. The leadership of that nationwide protest wascrushed by guns and tanks in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, giving thePeople's Republic a fearsome notoriety throughout the world," hesaid.</P><P>In his speech at the party congress, Jiang ordered further severerestrictions on religion, expression, assembly and the media.</P><P>Jiang's reform of China's state-owned enterprises by privatizingthem will result in enormous unemployment, Elegant noted.</P><P>"With a floating population of some 150 million unemployed, mostfrom rural areas, China cannot afford to throw an additional 100million out of work when, say, 150,000 loss-making enterprises gobankrupt," he said.</P><P>"Yet the alternative is a breakdown of the banking and financialsystem that could inflict even more grievous wounds, destabilizingthe social order and threatening the hold of the Communist Party," hesaid.</P><P>"Tension is already high. Swathes of prosperity along the coastare sadly offset by large areas of poverty inland. The farmers, whostill make up some 65 percent of the population, are extremelydiscontented and resentful of the cities' well-being," he said.</P><P>He noted that armed clashes are already occurring between thepolice, even the army, and the disgruntled in both town and country,as well as with disaffected minorities.</P><P>"Despite soaring economic growth in coastal provinces, which isbased largely on China's literally inexhaustible pool of cheap labor,the prospects for Beijing are not bright," he said. "Jiang has won asignal victory. But it is somewhat like beating out the competitionto become captain of the Titanic," he said.</P><P>He said: "It is a terrible thing to be an intelligent communistleader nowadays, few as there are. The more intelligent you are, themore enlightened your policies, the faster you tread the slipperyroad towards self-destruction," Elegant commented.</P></TEXT></DOC>

Chang)</DATELINE><TEXT><P>The big fear in Vancouver these days isthey're going back -- those Hong Kong big-money investors who havebeen immigrating to British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, and who, withtheir wads of cash and trans-Pacific connections, were supposed toturn this laid-back city into some kind of frantic New York West.</P><P>The Toronto Star reported Monday that every few days, there isanother story in the Vancouver press testifying to this worryingphenomenon. Only 23 homes sold for more than C$1 million (US$725,000)in Greater Vancouver this year, one newspaper reported ominously.Another report noted that the average price for a home on the city'swest side, the area favored by wealthy Chinese immigrants, has fallenby C$250,000 (US$181,000), or 27 percent.</P><P>"The Chinese are going back to Hong Kong," one real estate agentwas quoted as explaining. And the province is spooked -- to such anextent that Premier Glen Clark's New Democratic Party (NDP)government is quietly asking Ottawa to back off from plans to maketax evasion by the rich more difficult, according to theVancouver-datelined story.</P><P>It was referring to a law requiring wealthy Canadian residents todisclose all worldwide assets worth more than C$100,000. In BritishColumbia, the law is a "cause celebre": From the Vancouver Board ofTrade to the NDP, the asset disclosure law is blamed for the exodusof rich Hong Kong immigrants.</P><P>"If you don't want the rich, you'll get more refugees andfamily-class immigrants," developer David Choi, son of Hong Kongmultimillionaire C.K. Choi, warned in the Vancouver Sun newspaper.</P><P>"The Chinese are very private about their money," Jenny Kwan, a31-year-old NDP member of the B.C. legislature, told The Star. "This(disclosure) law goes against our culture."</P><P>"I don't support tax evasion and never will," Clark said in aninterview. "But the question is: Is this the only way to deal withthe problem? Let's make sure this cure for tax evasion is the rightone and doesn't discourage the kind of investment we want."</P><P>The reason for the premier's concern is that immigration has beenbig business for British Columbia. Since the groundbreaking agreementbetween Britain and mainland China in 1984 to return Hong Kong toBeijing's rule at midnight June 30, 1997, Canada has been workinghard to woo the territory's wealthiest inhabitants.</P><P>In 1986, two new categories of landed immigrant were invented toattract the moneyed. A so-called entrepreneurial immigrant could wina place in Canada by promising to create at least one job. And a richperson with C$350,000 to invest (or in some cases C$250,000) couldqualify as an investor immigrant.</P><P>After three years, if these business immigrants met all the othercriteria, they were granted citizenship.</P><P>The programs have attracted well-to-do immigrants from Hong Kong,Taiwan and, more recently, mainland China. While many went to theToronto area, the largest concentration of business immigrantssettled in Vancouver.</P><P>David Ley, director of the University of British Columbia'sCenter of Excellence for the Study of Immigration and Integration,estimates that since 1990, about 50,000 business immigrants from HongKong have settled in Greater Vancouver.</P><P>They, and the money they brought with them, buffered B.C. fromthe recession of the '90s. Vancouver in particular prospered, as thenewcomers -- seemingly impervious to high housing prices -- bid upthe city's already overheated housing market.</P><P>There was some grumbling as the city absorbed thousands of newAsian immigrants, but in the main, British Columbians welcomed themoney. They didn't want it to stop, the Star said.</P><P>In fact, the vast majority of people from Hong Kong who came toCanada were not rich. As Kwan points out, most were like her parents:they settled, found work and set about making a life in a new place.</P><P>Immigration from Hong Kong peaked in 1994 as those planning toleave hurried to get out before the handover to mainland China. Thatyear, 10,296 business immigrants and their families settled inBritish Columbia. By last year, that number had dropped to 7,058.</P><P>But many of these wealthier investor immigrants had options notopen to their compatriots. As Gabriel Yiu, a 35-year-old broadcasterand small-business owner notes, for some immigrants a Canadianpassport was simply a form of insurance.</P><P>"In the Chinese community, we understand the problems," said Yiu,who immigrated from Hong Kong six years ago. "We have no harshfeeling toward those who leave. But we also hear of cases where thehusband makes plenty of money in Hong Kong and pays no Canadiantaxes, yet his family lives here."</P></TEXT></DOC>
